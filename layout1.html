                <h4>How to Create an Effective SEO Strategy</h4>
                <br>
                In this post, you’re going to learn exactly how to create and implement an effective SEO strategy, step by step.
                <br>
                <h5>Backlinko – Organic traffic – September 2021</h5><br>
                So if you’re looking to get higher Google rankings, this guide is for you.
                <br>
                <h3>What Is an SEO Strategy?</h3><br>
                An SEO strategy is a plan to create, optimize, and promote content to improve its visibility in search engine results, attracting more organic traffic to a website. It involves a variety of techniques, such as keyword research, on-page optimization, technical SEO, and link building.
                
                In other words: an SEO strategy is the process that you follow when you want to get more organic traffic.
                
                With that, here are the steps to create an SEO strategy in 2024:
                <br>
                Step #1: Create a List of Keywords<br>
                Step #2: Analyze Google’s First Page<br>
                Step #3: Identify Your Competitors<br>
                Step #4: Create Something Different or Better<br>
                Step #5: Add a Hook<br>
                Step #6: Optimize For On-Page SEO<br>
                Step #7: Optimize For Search Intent<br>
                Step #8: Focus on Content Design<br>
                Step #9: Build Links to Your Page<br>
                Step #10: Improve and Update Your Content<br>
 <h1>Step #1: Create a List of Keywords</h1><br>
                Keyword research is usually the first step of any legit SEO strategy.<br>
                
                And one of the best ways to find keywords that your target customers search for?<br>
                
                Google Suggest to
                
                Start typing a keyword into Google’s search field, and it will populate a list of suggestions:<br>
                
                Google search suggestions
                These usually make great keywords for SEO because they come straight from Google.
                
                (Which means you know that people are actually searching for them.)
                
                Plus, longer keywords (known as “long tail keywords”) tend to be less competitive than “short tail” terms.<br>
                
                Long tail keywords
                So even though long tails have relatively low search volume levels, they’re much easier to rank for.
                
                I recommend typing a few different keywords into Google until you have a list of about 10 keywords.
                
                If you want to check out the search volume and competition levels for those terms, you can use a keyword tool like Semrush or Ubersuggest.
                <br>
                SEMrush and Ubersuggest<br>
                If you want to dive deeper into keyword research, you can check out this video.
                
                
                Once you have 10 keywords jotted down, you’re ready for step #2.
                <br>
                <h1>Step #2: Analyze Google’s First Page</h1><br>
                OK, so you found a handful of keywords.
                
                Now it’s time to see who already ranks for those keywords.
                
                To do that, just type one of the keywords that you found into Google.
                <br>
                Google search – Paleo desserts<br>
                Scan the top 10 results:
                
                <br>
                And jot down any patterns that you notice.
                <br>
                For example, the SERPs for “SEO Tools” is PACKED with lists of tools:
                <br>
                SEO tools – List posts in SERP<br>
                So if you wanted to cover that topic on your site, you’d want to note that the first page results are made up mostly of list posts.
                
                And you’d probably want to publish a list post on your blog.
                <br>
               <h1> Step #3: Identify Your Competitors</h1>
                My favorite tool for SEO competitor analysis is Semrush. Their tool makes the process super easy and can save you a lot of time.
                
                First, click on “Domain Overview” and type in your URL:
                
                Enter your domain for an overview
                Then scroll down to the bottom, and you’ll find a section called “Main Organic Competitors”
                <br>
                Competitor Analysis 2<br>
                These competitors are websites that are ranking for similar keywords and targeting similar audiences as you are.
                
                If you click on the “View all…” button, you’ll be able to review all your competitors as well as more insightful info.
                
                You can look at how many common keywords you share with these domains, and the amount of traffic these sites are pulling in:
                <br>
                Common keywords and traffic generated<br>
                The “Common Keywords” section is useful as it shows you the total number of keywords you share with each site.
                
                If you see sites with a high number of common keywords, then you can consider them your competitors.
                
                At the end of this step, you should have identified at least 4-5 main organic competitors.
                <br>
                <h1>Step #4: Create Something Different or Better</h1><br>
                Now it’s time to create some super high-quality content.
                
                When it comes to SEO content, you’ve got two options:
                <Br>
                Option #1: You can create something different.
                <br>
                Option #2: You can create something better.
                <br>
                Sometimes you want to create something bigger and better than what’s out there.
                
                (aka The Skyscraper Technique.)
                
                But sometimes you’re better off with content that’s completely different.
                <br>
                Why?
                <br>
                Because it helps your content stand out.
                <br>
                For example:
                
                A while back I noticed that most content about “SEO tools” only listed 10-20 tools.
                
                And I knew that publishing another list of 20 tools wouldn’t work.
                
                So I decided to create a list of 177 SEO tools.
                
                Backlinko – SEO tools post
                That post now ranks in the top 3 for the keyword “SEO Tools”:
                
                Google SERP – SEO tools
                <br>
                <h1>Step #5: Add a Hook</h1>
                <br>
                If you want to improve your search engine rankings in 2024, you need to get backlinks.
                
                (And lots of them.)
                
                In fact, according to a study by Stone Temple Consulting that was published on the Moz blog, links are still strongly correlated with first page Google rankings.
                
                Quadratic mean spearman correlation
                Which means they’re still a key Google ranking factor.
                <br>
                The question is: how do you do it?
                <br>
                Well, you need to figure out why people link to specific pieces of content in your industry.
                
                (Also known as “The Hook”.)
                
                Then, include that “Hook” in your content.
                
                Let’s look at a real-life example:
                
                A while ago I noticed more and more bloggers writing about voice search.
                
                Bloggers writing about voice search
                I noticed something else too:
                <br>
                When people wrote about voice search, they linked to content that featured stats and data:
                
                Voice search writing linked to content featuring stats and data
                So I decided to do a voice search study that was packed with stats:
                
                Backlinko – Voice search SEO study
                To date, this single post has racked up 5.6K backlinks:
                
                Voice search SEO study – Backlinks
                And 90%+ of these backlinks cite a specific stat from my post:
                <br>
                Backlinks cite specific stats from post
                That said:
                
                Data is just one type of “Hook” that you can use to build links to your content.
                
                Another Hook that’s working well right now is Ultimate Guides.
                
                When you publish an ultimate guide, your guide itself is The Hook.
                <br>
                I’ll explain with an example…
                <br>
                A few years back I published Link Building: The Definitive Guide.
                
                Backlinko – Link building guide
                It was (and still is) the most complete guide to link building out there.
                
                Every now and again a blogger will mention “link building” in a post.
                
                But they don’t have room to cover the entire topic.
                
                So they link to my guide as a way for their readers to learn more:
                
                Bloggers link out to my guide
                Very cool.
                <br>
                <h1>Step #6: Optimize For On-Page SEO</h1>
                <br>
                This step is all about keyword-optimizing your content for SEO.
                
                There’s a lot more to on-page SEO than I could cover in a single post.
                
                So if you want to learn more about optimizing your content for SEO, this video can help.
                
                
                That said, here are three core on-page SEO techniques that I recommend focusing on in 2024.
                <br>
                Internal Linking
                <br>
                Yup, internal linking still works.
                
                But you have to do it right.
                
                Specifically, you want to link from high-authority web pages to pages that need more authority.
                <br>
                High authority pages
                <br>
                For example, few years ago I published Google Search Console: The Definitive Guide.
                
                Backlinko – Google Search Console
                So I found a page on my site with a ton of authority…
                
                Backlinko – Google ranking factors
                …and linked from that page to my new guide.
                
                "Google Ranking Factors" post – Link to guide
                Simple.
                <br>
                Short, Keyword-Rich URLs
                <br>
                Our analysis of 11.8 million Google search results found something that surprised a lot of people:
                
                When it comes to search engine optimization, short URLs generally outperform long URLs.
                Short URLs tend to outrank long URLs
                That’s why I make my URLs either just my keyword…
                <br>
                SEO Checklist – URL
                … Or my target keyword plus one more word:<br>
                
                Backlinks Guide – URL
                Either way works.
                <br>
                Semantic SEO
                <br>
                Finally, I optimize my content for Semantic SEO.
                <br>
                In other words:
                <br>
                I find words that are related to my target keyword.
                
                Then, I use those terms in my content.
                
                To do this yourself, type your target keyword into Google Images.
                
                Enter keyword into Google Images
                And Google will give you words and phrases they consider closely related to that topic:
                <br>
                Google Images – Related terms<br>
                Then, type the same keyword into a normal Google search. And scroll down to the “Searches related to…” section.
                <br>
                SEO audit – Searches related to<br>
                Finally, sprinkle any of the terms that you find into your content:
                <br>
                And you’re set.
                <br>
                <h1>Step #7: Optimize For Search Intent</h1><br>
                In other words: The Skyscraper Technique 2.0.
                
                I’ll show you how this works with a quick example.
                
                A few years ago I wrote a post about getting more traffic to your site.
                <br>
                Increase Website Traffic post – Older
                It did OK.
                But it never cracked the top 5 for my target keyword (“increase website traffic”).
                <br>
                And when I analyzed Google’s first page, I realized why:
                <br>
                My page didn’t satisfy the search intent for that keyword.
                
                I’ll explain…
                
                Most of the content ranking for “increase website traffic” listed bite-sized traffic tips.
                
                "Increase Website Traffic" – Existing content
                But my post gave them a high-level process.
                
                Backlinko – Increase website traffic post – High-level process
                This wasn’t the user experience search engine visitors wanted. So I rewrote my content to match this keyword’s Search Intent.
                <br>
                Specifically, I turned my process into a list post:
                <br>
                Increase Website traffic is now a list post
                <br>
                And now that my content matched Search Intent, it ranked in the top 3 for my target keyword:
                <br>
                "increase website traffic" SERPs
                Which led to a 70.43% boost in search engine traffic compared to the old version of the post:
                <br>
                Increase Website Traffic – Organic traffic boost
                That said:<br>
                
                You can (and should) publish content with Search Intent in mind right out of the gate.
                
                In fact, that’s what I did with this post: The Ultimate SEO Audit.
                <br>
                Backlinko – SEO site audit
                I saw that most of the content ranking for “SEO Audit” listed out non-technical steps.
                <br>
                SEO Audit – Existing content – Non-technical steps
                <br>
                So I included simple strategies that anyone could use:
                
                SEO site audit – Post steps
                And this Search Intent optimization helped my post crack the first page of Google within a month.
                <br>
                <h1>Step #8: Focus On Content Design</h1><br>
                The design might be the most underrated part of content marketing.
                
                You can have the best content ever written.
                
                But if it looks like this…
                <br>
                <h3>Bad website</h3>
                …It’s usually not going to get much traction.
                For example,<br>
                Backlinko – Local SEO guide<br>
                These guides are designed and coded 100% from scratch using WordPress.
                
                (Which makes them expensive to make.)
                <br>
                That said:
                <br>
                The great content design doesn’t have to break the bank.
                
                In fact, here are 4 types of visual content that are super easy to pull off.
                <br>
                Graphs and Charts
                <br>
                These work so well that I try to include at least one chart in every post.
                
                Include at least one chart in every post
                <br>
                Why?
                <br>
                Because they make data easy to understand.
                
                For example, take this stat from my mobile SEO guide.
                <br>
                Stat as text<br>
                I don’t know about you, but I have a hard time picturing 27.8 billion anything.
                
                So I had our designer create a nice chart.
                <br>
                Stat as graphic
                <br>
                As a bonus, people will sometimes use your chart in a blog post… and link back to you:
                <br>
                Graphic used by site with link
                <br>
                Screenshots and Pictures
                <br>
                You might have noticed that I use lots of screenshots in every post.
                
                In fact, this single post has 78 screenshots:
                <br>
                Backlinko – SEO Checklist
                <br>
                To be clear:
                <br>
                I don’t use screenshots just for the sake of using screenshots.
                
                I only use them if it helps someone implement a specific step.
                
                For example, these screenshots make the 2 steps from this guide much easier to follow:
                <br>
                Easy to follow steps using screenshots
                <br>
                That said:
                <br>
                Screenshots only make sense when you describe something technical.
                <br>
                What if you’re in a non-technical niche… like fitness?
                <br>
                Well, pictures serve the same purpose.
                
                For example, my friend Steve Kamb at Nerd Fitness uses pictures to show you how to do exercises the right way:
                <br>
                Picture used to demonstrate an exercise
                <br>
                Blog Post Banners
                <br>
                Unlike graphs and screenshots, blog post banners serve no practical purpose.
                <br>
                Here at Backlinko, we use a banner at the top of each post:
                <br>

                <br>
                Graphics and Visualizations
                <br>
                Graphics and visualizations are kind of like charts.
                
                But instead of visualizing data, they visualize concepts.
                
                For example, in this post I explain how all 4 versions of your site should redirect to the same URL:
               <br> 
                Visualization redirect example
                <br>
                This concept isn’t rocket science.
                
                But it’s hard to picture this idea in your mind.
                
                So our designer made a simple visual that makes this concept easy to understand.
                <br>
                Redirect visualization
                <br>
                <h1>Step #9: Build Links to Your Page</h1>
                <br>
                Now it’s time to actively build links to your content.
                
                Specifically, we’re going to tap into 3 link building strategies that are working really well right now.
                <br>
                Broken Link Building
                <br>
                Here’s where you find a broken link on someone’s site…
                
                …and offer your content as a replacement.
                
                For example, this is an outreach email that I sent to a blogger in the marketing niche:
                <br>
                Brian outreach email – BlueGlass
                (Note how specific I am. I don’t say “Please consider linking to me in a blog post”. I have a specific place on a specific page where my link makes sense.)
                <br>
                And because I helped the person out before asking for anything, they were happy to add my link:
                <br>
                Outreach email reply – BlueGlass
                <br>
                Competitor Analysis
                <br>
                This strategy is old school.
                
                But it still works.
                
                First, find a site that’s ranking for a keyword you want to rank for.
                
                For example, I’m trying to rank for the keyword “SEO Audit”.
                
                So I grab this result from the first page…
                <br>
                Google SERP – Ahrefs SEO audit post<br>
                …and look at their backlinks.
                <br>
                Ahrefs – SEO audit post – Backlinks<br>
                I can see that this page has links from 407 domains:
                <br>
                Ahrefs – SEO audit post – Referring domains<br>
                So I should be able to get at least a handful of the same links they have.
                
                To do that, I go one by one through their backlinks.
                <br>
                Go through backlinks – Ahrefs<br>
                And find pages where my link would add value.
                
                For example, this post mentions my competitor’s content by name:
                <br>
                Post mentioning Ahrefs' content by name<br.
                There’s no reason to link to my post there. So I moved on to the next opportunity on the list.
                
                And I came across this post:
                <br>
                Link to Ahrefs – Part of a resource list
                A list that would be even better and more complete with a link to my SEO audit post.
                <br>
                Evangelist Method
                <br>
                This strategy is less about links… and more about getting your content in front of the right people.
                
                (Specifically: people that run blogs in your niche.)
